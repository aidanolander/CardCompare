Compare Magic Cards!

This is a streamlit tool to compare Magic the Gathering cards from Hasbro's Wizards of the Coast. 
Ideally used for deckbuilding when you want to add some cards but don't know which cards to cut. 
Recommend not using too many cards, otherwise the process gets very slow. 


Thank you to Scryfall for their wonderful API.
